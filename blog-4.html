  <h3>Some Words Are Too Awkward to Say</h3>
  <label>2019-05-10</label>
  <p>So I'd just type them here and be quiet.</p>
<p>Today is my last day at bitmaker.</p>
<p>I've learned so much in the past two months. Countless first times. From never used a terminal to git pushing everyday, from never messed with anything other than Windows, to being able to reinstall Linux and setting up Python env within an hour (thanks Ken!), from knowing nothing except browsing the web to knowing HTML CSS requests regex API XPath scrapping... to oop, to pelican and fire and flask, to hacking with APIs, to spinning up simple web app... And all those coding and machine learning stuff.</p>
<p>It's hard to put the experience to words... It's like being constantly thrilled. Everything seems magical and everyday new worlds open. </p>
<p>Max is a wizard of a teacher. He is so damn smart and has the miraculous ability to make things appear 10x easier. I'm also thankful for all the encouragement and tangible help from my classmates. My countless questions and their endless patience, their "I believe in you" when I myself wasn't sure. And the fun of all the chattings even though most of the time I was just listening.</p>
<p>I'm used to getting up every morning and looking forward to the class and seeing everyone. I have been dreading this day when all of it comes to an end. And it finally does. I'm writing this post so that I won't tear up out there. </p>
<p>It's been such a pleasure to be in this with you guys. Whatever you ever aspire to, you have my best wishes, always.</p>
